## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- See a homepage which shows a hero section of the popular movie and a list of other movies.
- click the individual movies in the list which in turn leads to the page dedicated to that particular movie.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- Learnt how I could use useRef hook to skip the initial render of the useEffect hook.

- Learnt to create a time which will trigger after a specified period of time.

- Learnt to make multipage sites using 'react-router-dom' library.

- In case if someone wants to use 'useParams' with a class component, then a trick is to pass 'useParams' as a property in a separate functional component whose main part is the class component that we want to use 'useParams' in.

- I could use 'prop-types' package if I'm not using TypeScript.

- Learnt to create customHook.

- Got an introduction to TypeScript.

- Learnt to persist state in SessionStorage.

### To know further

- The `max-width` property doesn't seem to work on the img component created using styled-components whereas the `width` property is working fine. But again the same issue wasn't there in the video.
